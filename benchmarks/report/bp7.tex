\subsection{BP 7:
 Monai valley beach (Laboratory)}

\subsubsection{Problem specification}

\begin{itemize}

\item PMEL-135, pp 6 \& 45-46.

\item Problem description provided by Dmitry \cite{bp7description}.

\item The original experiment is fully described by Masuyama and Tanaka
\cite{MatsuyamaTanaka:monai}.

\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{What we did}

\begin{itemize}
\item We solved the nonlinear shallow water equations in Cartesian
coordinates with $g=9.81$ and no friction.  
\item We used the given initial wave to specify a boundary condition at the left
boundary up to time 20.  This was done by filling ghost cells each time step
at the left edge of the computational domain, with cell centers at $x = -
\frac 1 2 \Delta x$ and $x = -\frac 3 2 \Delta x$.
The depth at any such point $x_0$ at arbitrary time $t_0$ should be roughly
the same as the depth at $x=0$ at time $t_0 - x_0/c_0$, where $c_0 =
\sqrt{gh_0}$ is the wave speed based on the constant depth.  This value was
estimated by 
interpolating from the given time trace at $x=0$.
To fully specify the ghost cell values we also need the velocity or momentum
in these cells.  This is estimated by assuming the wave is a right-going
simple wave, so that the Riemann invariant $u - 2\sqrt{gh}$ is constant
through the wave.  Inserting the interpolated $h$ value and then setting this
equal to $-2\sqrt{gh_0}$ gives the expression for the velocity $u$ used in
the ghost cell.

\item After time 20, the boundary condition procedure
switched to non-reflecting boundary condition 
at left boundary, so reflected waves exit.  
(Note that the wave tank was much longer than computational domain specified.)
\item We solved on $423\times 243$ grid (same as bathymetry), with no
adaptive mesh refinement.
\item We also solved on $211\times 121$ grid, coarser by roughly a factor of
2, for comparison as a test of convergence.
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{Gauge comparisons}

\Fig{bp7gauges} shows a comparison of the GeoClaw results with the
laboratory values at the three gauges requested, with both grid resolutions. 
The two resolutions give very comparable results, indicating that the
solution presented is close to a converged solution of the shallow water
equations.  The results are in general a good match to the laboratory
measurements.

\subsubsection{Frame comparisons}

See \Fig{bp7framesA} and \Fig{bp7framesB} for comparisons of the Frames 10,
25, 40, 55, and 70 from the overhead movie with GeoClaw results at roughly
corresponding times.  These results are from the $423\times 243$ grid (same
as given bathymetry).

The movie had a rate of 30 fps, so the frames are 0.5 seconds apart. However,
it is not clear what the starting time was for Frame 1 relative to the
simulation time.   In the Benchmark Description \cite{bp7description}, it is
stated that ``frame 10 approximately occurs at 15.3 seconds'', but then later
``it is recommend that each modeler find times of the snapshots that best fit
the data''.   We found reasonably good agreement starting at 15 seconds for
Frame 1 and then taking 0.5 second increments, as shown in \Fig{bp7framesA}
and \Fig{bp7framesB}.

The yellow dashed lines on the frames from the movie show the approximate
shoreline (and were provided as part of the benchmark specification
\cite{bp7description}).  The actual shoreline location is of course somewhat
ambiguous in the movie, and also in the computation.  The figures of the
GeoClaw computation show the shoreline two different ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item The cells colored blue are finite volume cells where the fluid depth is
greater than 0.0001 m. Those colored green have less fluid or are dry.
\item The black dashed line is a contour line where depth $= 0.002$ m, which
agrees better with the movie frames and might be a depth that can actually be
detected in the movie frames.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Runup in the valley}
The file {\tt OBS\_RUNUP.txt} from the benchmark specification contains
the runup at 3 locations as observed in 6 runs of the same wavetank
experiment.  The relevant location for runup in the valley is the first
point at $x=5.1575, y=1.88$ m.  The six values given are 0.0875, 0.09,
0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.09, with an average value of approximately $0.09$.

In the computation, the maximum runup was observed at time $t\approx 16.5$.
This frame is shown in \Fig{bp7runup} with a white dot at the location
$x=5.1575, y=1.88$ and several contour levels marked.  The contour lines are
at levels 0.01 m apart.  The maximum runup appears to be around 0.08 to 0.10
meters depending on what water depth is used to judge.

\subsection{Lessons learned}

\todo{Make any relevant comments or observation regarding the benchmark itself,
the available data provided, the relevance of the benchmark to tsunami
science in general and to validating your specific model in particular. 
Report problems and make recommendations regarding improving the benchmark
or its data, as appropriate.}


The input data only goes out to 20 seconds.
The first waves are modeled well, but later waves  in the laboratory data
(not shown here) are not seen in the
computation.  If a longer time history was provided for the input data, it
may be possible to match later waves better.  Note that the computational
domain is only part of the wave tank, which was 205 m long
\cite{MatsuyamaTanaka:monai}.
Presumably it is impossible to obtain more data at this point.

This benchmark problem appears to be a good test for tsunami models.  It has
been widely used an many models have been shown to give results that agree
quite well with the laboratory measurements.

The benchmark problem specification could be improved by specifying the
computational grid(s) that are to be used.  We show results for a grid that
matches the resolution of the bathymetry provided and a second computation
at half the resolution, but this should be specified as part of the problem.
