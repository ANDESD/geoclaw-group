\section{Introduction}

(Describe your NTHMP funded effort regarding inundation mapping, i.e., which
area this covers, which types of tsunami sources are affecting your area and
hence which benchmark problems in the list you will be addressing and why.)

Funding is expected from NTHMP partner FEMAâ€™s Risk Mapping, Assessment, and
Planning (Risk MAP) Program, as part of the BakerAECOM coastal engineering
effort for the FEMA California Coastal Analysis and Mapping (CCAMP) Project.
Funding will also be sought to provide Washington State with tsunami
modeling and mapping in support of tsunami hazard assessment and emergency
management planning and education.  Tsunami sources in these geographic
areas include earthquakes and landslides, and we will therefore address
benchmark problems that deal with these sources.

\section{Model description}
(Describe and give relevant references to the model(s) you are using for
your tsunami source, propagation, and coastal impact/inundation simulations.
As a minimum, provide general information on the type of models you are
using, including related restriction/assumptions. Refer to (preferably peer
reviewed) papers where your model equations and other relevant validation
and/or case studies for tsunami or otherwise have been published.)

\section{Benchmark results}
(For each selected (PMEL) benchmark problem, please document how you defined
your model input data, grid and various other parameters to simulate each
problem. 

Provide results as figures (and raw data) following future formatting
instructions, to the relevant site and/or coordinator. Also summarize your
results as simple error indicators of the performance of the model (e.g.,
mean, max, rms errors).)
